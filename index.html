           Hello, Lindsay!

        <h1>Lindsay Kristen (BradLey) Nickalo</h1>
           <p>   

I, Austyn Gregory Nickalo, have a confession to make...
I Love you... and the reason for this are simple.

You are Beautiful
You are Brilliant
You are SEXY
You are the smartest person I know
You are the most stubborn person I know
You are the person I want to grow old with
You are the person I want to spend the rest of my life with
You have a heart of love and take care of everyone around you

Now those are just a few reasons why I am so madly in love with you, but here are some of my favorite
things about you.

Your Titties!
The freckles on your shoulder that I get to kiss
Your beautiful long natural hair
The small of your back that I get to kiss

Now these lists could go on forever. You are the love of my life, and every day is a blessing with you.
Some days may be hard, but every day grows our marriage and I have no regrets. Well that was a lie....I
do have one single regret, and that was not meeting you sooner. Because you make me the best version
of myself. You have changed me in so many ways and have made me the happiest I have ever been. I
aspire to be the best husband, future father, and person I can be because of you. You truly are the love
of my life. Thank you for being you and thank you for allowing me to love you.
Ps. And of course thank you for that hot body for me to enjoy for the rest of our days!
